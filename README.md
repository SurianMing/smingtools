# smingtools
A set of cli tools for streamlining dev processes in a wsl2 ubuntu environment.

These are just a few tools that I use when developing in vscode in a wsl2 environment.

They're native scripts rather than dotnet tools, so I use the snippet in the config/bashrc_config file to load them up.

I'm not a Linux/Ubuntu/... developer - I just search the web when I've got an idea of something I think would be useful
and enjoy the challenge of trying to get it working natively.

Anyone who has comments about ways I'm doing things - and particularly ideas about these tools should really
work in an Ubuntu environment - I'd love to hear.
